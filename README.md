In this repository we are going to explain, the linear regression and the logistic regression.  

We are going to:
1. Explain mathematically linear and logistic regression
2. Create a linear regression and a logistic regression from scratch
3. Use our models and compare it with sklearn models
4. Inteprete the output of our models
